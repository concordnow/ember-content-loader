## ember-content-loader

This addon is a port of [react-content-loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader).

It's is an out-of-the-box solution to create custom skeleton screens. It comes with presets for lists, code, Facebook, and Instagram styled loading cards. Allows for custom SVG, elements, and color.

## Skeleton screens

> A skeleton screen is a user experience pattern that’s shown to reduce load time frustration. [Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797) coined this term for displaying neutral elements while gradually loading content into a container. This creates better “perceived performance”, as occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time.

Skeleton screens is a UI/UX design technique to mitigate focus on the loading process, versus the actual content that is loading.

In his own words, they are “essentially a blank version of a page into which information is **gradually loaded**.”

These visual placeholders are often light grey boxes that appeared instantly in areas where content had not yet completed loading.

### Perceived performance

Rather than most performance or UX wins, this pattern only focuses on improving the perceived experience. When compared against a blank screen or a traditional spinner, skeleton screens are seen as shorter in duration
